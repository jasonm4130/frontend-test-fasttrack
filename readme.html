<h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
<p>Nothing fancy here, just pure html no templating language used. Started with HTML5 boilerplate.</p>
<h2 id="sass-css">SASS / CSS</h2>
<p>Sass was used as a preprocessor for the css files. Keeping everything nice and tidy in a single file for faster load times, plus auto browser prefixing, minification and source maps. I use Prepros for simple sass projects and gulp for more advanced flows.</p>
<p>I included bootstrap reboot and grid as helpers to speed development as well as jquery ui css for the datpicker styles.</p>
<p>I took a mobile first aproach to the minimal media queries needed.</p>
<h2 id="js">JS</h2>
<p>Using jquery UI framework for the datepicker, and jquery match height to dynamically match the height of the panels/boxes.</p>
